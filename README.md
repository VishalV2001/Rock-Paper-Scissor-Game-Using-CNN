# Rock Paper Scissor Game Using CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Leveraging a dataset of hand gesture images, the CNN is trained to accurately recognize and classify these gestures into their respective categories. The objective is to achieve high accuracy in gesture recognition by training and evaluating the model using the provided dataset.

## Key Objectives
- **Dataset Utilization**: Use a comprehensive dataset of hand gesture images for training and evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Develop and train a CNN model to classify hand gestures into Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance to ensure high accuracy in gesture recognition.
- **Script Development**: Create scripts to load a pre-trained model for predicting hand signs from input images and to simulate the Rock-Paper-Scissors game using two hand sign images as inputs.

## Results
The CNN model demonstrates high accuracy in classifying hand gestures for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The developed scripts effectively apply the trained model to predict hand signs and simulate the game, showcasing the practical applicability of the CNN model.
